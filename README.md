# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition-with-Deep-Neural-Networks

We have implemented deep neural networks for hand-written digit recognition from scratch.

The layers.py module has the implementations of all the various layers of a neural network. Specifically, it contains the Affine Layer (fully connected layer), sigmoid layer, Relu layer, Tanh layer, Softmax layer (the last layer of a deep neural network), Dropout layer (for regularization), batch normalization layer, Max Pooling layer and a Convolutional layer.

The learning_rules.py module has the implementation of various learning rules like standard Gradient Descent, Momentum, Adagrad and RMSProp.

The penalties.py module contains implementations of the L1 and L2 regularizarion methods.
